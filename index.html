        Dear <span class="name1"></span>, <br /><br />
        How are you doing? This is your son/daughter [first name], who is
        currently being gilded on the beach in Bandol. Our Airbnb is great, we
        even have a big terrace and a barbecue. Our schedule varies between
        lazing around, eating together, visiting the villages of the French
        Riviera and going out. I'll see you in a month and in the meantime I'll
        give you a big hug. P.S. Sorry for the sun cream spots on the postcard!
